    "I’m exhausted by the time I get home."
    "It was fun going through the show with Lauren, but it was way more involved than I expected."
    "It’s pretty quiet downstairs. Mom’s in the kitchen... of course she is. I really don't want to see her right now..."
    "We're having dinner as a family again, too. Surpriiiise. Happy birthday to me."
    "Maria is in her room and I have no idea where Alex is. Probably at his friend’s, I guess."
    "I'm just gonna duck in my room and lay low until Mom starts hollering..."
    # Transition to Bedroom
    "What the heck?! My desk is a mess!"
    "Ugh. Alex is always coming in here and ‘borrowing’ my stuff. I can’t count the number of pens and pencils he’s never returned."
    "Well, he’s not here, so I guess I can go into his room and get my things back."
    # Transition to brother’s bedroom
    "There are clothes and candy wrappers scattered everywhere. That boy is basically an animal."
    "There’s bits of paper and worksheets covering what passes for his desk."
    "My things have probably rolled down behind that."
    "I dig in behind his desk. It’s dusty as hell back here. I’m terrified to think what else might be behind here…"

    if tendollar:
        "Huh. Is this the quarter that he mentioned the other day?"
        "Don’t mind if I do."
        "I’ll call it interest on the ten dollars he owes me and keep searching."

    "My fingers find a box. That’s weird."
    "I drag it out. Sure enough, my things are underneath the box. This must have been knocked down recently."
    "Seriously, why does he never pick up after himself? Is he a toddler or something?"
    "I wonder if he’s hiding more of my stuff in this box. It kind of looks like a fancy pencil case."
    "I open it."

    "This looks really, {i}really{/i} sketchy... is this heroin? Like, the stuff you see on cop dramas?"
    "I can't really think of what else it could be, but... Alex can't be doing shit like that, right??"
    "I... should probably leave. This really isn't my problem. Let's not get involved."

    # Transition to bedroom
    "I slam my pencils and pens down on my desk and flop onto my bed."
    "The way Alex exploded on me, I guess it only confirms my suspicions."
    "A sinking feeling wallows in the pit of my stomach."
    "I can’t believe Alex. How could he get himself into heroin? He’s only fourteen!"
    "What should I do?"
    "I’d tell Mom, but she might actually kill Alex if I told her."
    "I sigh."
    "I guess I need to keep this to myself, for now."
    "I close my eyes and squeeze my pillow."
