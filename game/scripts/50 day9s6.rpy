    "Today was a good day of work for the two of us. Quality time with Lauren, work done on the sewing machine, and plenty of meaningful discourse."

    "Lauren's opening up to me. She's being honest with herself, too. She knows that she takes on more than she should. It's interesting to see why, and it's kinda inspirational."

    "After Lauren throws all her things together in her knapsack, we meet at the front door."
