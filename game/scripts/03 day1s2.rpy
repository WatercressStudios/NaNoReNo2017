    "You know, why did I ever expect anything different? Of course it'd be the same shit, even on this day. The thought 'today of all days' ruminates in my head for a second, but is quickly replaced with traces of my almost yet not quite forgotten dream."

    "Thinking of it, I can't remember any clear events, just the unmistakable feeling of safety, of calm, of peace. Something I can't seem to feel nowadays."

    "I haven't been able to feel anything really. It's been that way for a while. Sometimes I'll feel something, but it's always fleeting - and it's normally anger, or frustration."

    "Or it's something else… but I only feel that around Lauren. It's a strange feeling, a feeling that I can't quite put words to. That doesn't exactly deviate from the norm, however." 

    "I've always had difficulty describing my feelings to myself, and to others? Forget about it."

    "I hear a light, almost inaudible knocking on my door. The nervous nature of it betrays the culprit immediately - my sister."

    pro "Come in."

    "I speak out to her calmly. I don't want anyone else to hear me through the thin walls we have in this house."

    "The door opens slowly, the little one creeping in, her face red from what only could be tears."

    sis "I-I'm sorry to bug you…"

    "Ahhh, as shy as ever. She doesn't deal well with, well, anything really. I don't like it seeing her like this."

    "She's worried about the argument. I would be too, sis, I would be too, were it not for the regularity of the event."

    pro "No, no, you're not bugging me at all, don't you worry about that. Come over here, are you okay?"

    "I can't bring myself to leave my bed, but I can at least muster the energy to sit up."

    "She trudges over, sitting next to me, nuzzling in a close hug."

    pro "It's okay. I do too, but it's only natural, right? Our mother's very strict, and Alex, well... He's going through a phase right now." 

    "I can't help but doubt the very words I speak. I have no faith in either of them, and I find it difficult, lying right to my little sister's face."

    sis "probably?"

    "Her voice is shy and reserved. If she weren't so close, I wouldn't be able to hear a single word."

    "I continue to give her false hope."

    play voice "1-2-10.mp3" #potato
    pro "...Yeah. We'll see."

    "She remains quiet. Of course, I can't convince her. Why would I, if I can't even convince myself? I have zero faith in my brother, and even less faith in my mother."

    sis "Fiiine, I guess."

    "She wraps her arms further around my waist, hugging me tightly."

    play voice "1-2-17.mp3" #amree
    sis "Thank you."

    "She reluctantly releases me, giving me one last pitiful look."

    "Standing up, I ruffle her hair a bit before taking a seat at my desk. She situates herself under the covers before dozing off."

    "Okay, time for me to do something for her."

    "Hmm. I can't exactly do anything to fix the situation, nor would it be a good idea to get involved. Maybe I can get her a gift?"

    "Ah, that takes a bit more money than I have, and I'd rather not ask Dad to lend me any. Mom'll just nag me about my unemployment."

    "I can hear it now; 'Get a job' 'You're worthless without a career,' 'You're going nowhere with your life!'"

    "No thank you."

    "So, it'll have to be something that I can make. I could always whip out the old sewing machine. I haven't touched that thing in ages, and I really should."

    "Reaching over, I carefully pull it close, struggling with the weight of the damned thing. It scatters the random sketches I have sprawled across the table."

    "Relics of a better past, for sure."

    "So. What can I do, that's relatively cheap, and doesn't take too long to make?"

    "Not a dress, or any article of clothing really. It'd break both of the aforementioned rules that I've set for myself."

    "I glance back at Maria. Her face is peaceful, but her brow is furrowed. She has one of my pillows clutched tightly in her arms. She's hugging it close to her chest."

    "Damn, that brings back memories. Back when she used to bury herself in plushies, dolls, bears, you name it. She fit right in with her toys, too. They'd hug her back, almost like the pillow she's holding now."

    "Oh! That gives me an idea - I know just what to do! Back before Mom quit her job, Dad used to take Maria out to buy a plushie every once in awhile. She loved little things like that. She loved him, too."

    "That's it, I'll make her a plushie. I'm sure I have enough materials around here…"

    "I rummage through the few boxes of materials I have left from the golden ages, and I pull out just what I'll need to make what she needs."

    "It'll be a tight fit, but I'm sure I can make it work."

    "I begin by sketching out a 2D figure of the thing, electing to go with a small ram. The pencil glides across the worn page, over scattered memories and lost progress."

    "Eventually, I find that I've finished a good working draft. It's been only a few minutes, but I can already feel the creative high. It feels good to create. It's something I used to get lost in all the time."

    "I know it can't last, however. Everytime I hit this point, shortly after the world hits me again, and I lose the energy to continue."

    "That means that I'll have to hurry before that happens."

    "I move onto a more 3D approach, abandoning the sketch pencil for some colored pens and markers, using a black fine point to note the curves of the creature, ensuring that it'll appear 3D, at least to me."

    "It's a lot of work. I test out some colors on my previous sketch, moving towards a brown color set. I keep the eyes a nice button black."

    "Looking through my materials, I note that I have to make it small, probably something you can cradle - almost like a teddy bear would be."

    "My pace slows, the zealous fervor I had just a minute ago fading quicker than it came."

    "This is probably good enough for the night, yeah? Good enough is all that I need."

    "Time to chat with Lauren, anyways. She'd bug me all day tomorrow if I were to miss our nightly call."

    "I hide the sketches underneath the rest of the failed experiments, promising to myself to continue tomorrow night."

    "Flipping out my phone, I admire my lock screen. It's a picture of Lauren and I, smiling on a beach. Damn, it's been ages…"

    "I find her in my recent contacts before I tap the video call button. It's almost immediately answered."

    "I'm tired. Nothing new. At least the bed will be warm, right?"

    "I swivel the chair around, and I make my way to the bed. As expected, my sister is sound asleep. Gently, I get in bed with her, and I shut my eyes."

    "Finally, my favorite part of the day. Sleep."
