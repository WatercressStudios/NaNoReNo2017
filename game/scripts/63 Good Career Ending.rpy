    "I think Lauren's show was a bit of a zeitgeist for me."
    "I was only able to make time for a few costumes, but… they really popped out! People noticed them! They were a hit!"
    "I was… really surprised. Baffled, even. Lauren encouraged me the entire way, and I'm not sure I ever believed in myself then."
    "But now, the proof's right there. It's exhilarating!"
    "So I decided. This is what I wanted to do. It was time to get serious."
    "I enrolled in an arts school for a four year program in fashion design after high school."
    "I've learned a lot. They're teaching us about patterning, textiles, history of the industry…"
    "Lauren's going to the same school as well, though she's in a drama program."

        "We still sometimes bump into each other, but I've been trying to avoid that."
        "From time to time she'll ask me to design costumes for her show, but I'm always already busy with someone else's show."
        "There are a lot of passionate, talented people here."
    else:
        "She's been my strength. Whenever I get stuck from my own insecurities, she kicks me back into gear."
        "I'm even getting course credit for designing for her shows now… it's a pretty sweet deal."
        "I shouldn't be complacent, though. There are a lot of passionate, talented people here."
    "It just feels good to be among them. It's nice to feel that I belong."
    "I'm making plans to enter this year's fashion show. I got a really cute design in mind…"
    "I don't plan to win anything, but… it's fun to try."
    "I still have grandma's old sewing machine with me… maybe I'll use that for making the dress."
    "I use it for some smaller projects in the comfort of my dorm room."
    "It's nostalgic… comforting. Like seeing an old friend."
    "It's odd. I get a lot of questions about it, that I could be using a more recent model… one that's faster and more efficient."
    "I mean, I have those in easy enough reach. Industry-standard stuff, over in the workshop."
    "But… I like having it around. It reminds me of where I came from. How hard I worked to get here."
    "I owe a lot to my family, and my friends, for giving me the strength to get this far."
    "And now I'm getting to do something I really love for a living! Or… well, I'm getting there, at least."
    "I know everyone at home is really proud of me. I wonder if Maria still has that doll I made her."

    else:
        "Even Mom is starting to ask me for fashion advice from time to time."
    "I can't wait to go home for the holidays and see the family again…"

    "It's time to rest…"
