    "That's just it, though. Throughout each and every one of these dreams, I've had the opportunity to think through what's always troubling me."
    "I've designed this world for that very specific purpose, even if it took me this long to realize."
    "This is my escape. This is my reprieve."
    "If pain's a part of life, then I don't want a part of that."
    "This place, right here, this is my real home."

    "I can feel the presence of others in this old house. Focusing my hearing, I can pick up dull murmuring coming from… the dining room?"
    "I can’t help grinning. They aren’t seriously gonna do that, are they?"
