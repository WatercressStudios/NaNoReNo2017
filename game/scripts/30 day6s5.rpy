    "The walk to the park goes straight along my normal school route, which serves to cool my nerves a bit before meeting up with Lauren. After everything we've gone through today, I really need a break."

    "Too much going on. Too much action, too much excitement, too much activity."

    "Is that how progress feels?"

    "Does it make you feel this tired? Does it make you feel this {i}good{/i}? It's an emotional high. Something you'd feel after finishing a long term project, but much, much better."

    "While I'm incredibly nervous about the future, something tells me that it'll be alright."

    "I don't like that. Normally, I feel that the world is going to crumble around me, and for the most part, it has."

    "Change is weird."

    "Ignoring that thought, I move to think about just why things are going so well. Of course, it's Lauren."

    "I wonder if Lauren has the golden touch?"

    "Everything she's involved in ends up going pretty okay."

    "I still feel nervous, though. This nervousness, however, is because of Lauren, and not because of the events in my life."

    "I'm nervous to see her again. I think I'm slowly realizing just how much I like her, and that revelation simultaneously makes me happy and terrifies me."

    "I wonder if she thinks I'm a mess? If she's ashamed of my family? What does she think of all of this? It's embarrassing."

    "She's too nice for that, though."

    "Knowing that, why do I still feel this way? Fuck, listen to me. I'm like a fourteen year old girl all over again."

    "I wonder if I've always liked her this way. Maybe I've always been too afraid to take that extra step…"

    "I'm broken out of my thoughts as I approach the park. Ahead of me, Lauren sits on a bench, holding a book to her chest. She has a sort of… pained expression on her face."

    "Is something wrong?"

    "I take my time getting over to her, appreciating the time I have to gaze at her before she turns back into her normal, bubbly self."

    "I can't stare too long. I end up giving up the moment, allowing it to be lost to time. I sit next to her, and she turns to me with a smile on her face."

    pro"No, it isn't nothing. You've saved my ass, and you've done it on top of your already busy schedule. It means more than you can possibly know." 

    "I reach over and hug her - much to her surprise. She makes a small 'eep' before accepting, and reciprocating. I'm not a physical person, but she's earned it."

    "I can feel my heartbeat, and I can feel hers as well. They're both beating erratically fast."

    "After a moment of warmth, I pull back and look at her, a smile creeping up my face, yet another thing that I'm not known for."

    "The moonlight catches in her hair, giving her an almost angelic appeal - she's glowing, and in more ways than one."

    "I wonder…"

    "Would it be weird to compliment her? Would that be too forward?"

    "I'm not good with people, but I assume those are tears of happiness. My anxiety subsides, and I pull her in closer."

    "I never really noticed it before, but her skin is very soft. She takes care of herself, despite how busy she is."

    "It puts an entirely different light on the past few days."

    "He's going through his own personal hell right now."

    "We part ways, and for the first time in forever, my mind’s filled with only warm thoughts."
