    "...Well. It's been a difficult time for us."
    "In little over a week, my family was torn apart at the seams."
    "My brother in the hospital, my father broken and battered from work, my mother's sudden disappearance, my little sister trying to put on a brave face."
    "And me, in the middle of it all. Wondering what happened."
    "It's exhausting to even think about it all, but… even trying to connect the dots, I never thought in a million years that it would ever come to this."

    "She must be a lot happier now. The last few years have been pretty good for her."
    "I wish I could be happier, but it just feels… weird? Like that feeling that an ambush is about to get me."
    "But she's… well, still high-strung, but she finds time to relax, nowadays."
    "She's going back to school, too. She teaches physics at community college, but knowing her, she'll claw her way up to a university before long."
    "Sometimes I see her practicing some lectures with Maria at home. A lot of it goes over my head, but…" 
    "Maria's pretty into it lately. I knew she was smart, and she had to grow up really fast in a short time, but…"
    "They've spent more time together, the past few months. It's some high level material too."
    "Maybe Mom's happier she found someone she could really relate to. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree… they say Maria's gonna get to skip a few grades!"
