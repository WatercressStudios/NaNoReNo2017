    "The audience roars with applause as Lauren's time on the center stage comes to an end."
    "The theater is filled to the brim. I'd say this was quite successful for her. Seeing her act on stage was super cute, especially knowing that I'd helped her with many of her lines."
    "She was probably very nervous, but she didn't let it show, not one bit."
    "She's good like that."
    "The applause finishes, and I go out to meet up with her after the performance."
    "Compared to her, I'm a nervous wreck."
    "Today's the day… the day I ask her out."
    "I've had these feelings for a while now, but I only recently realized just what the feelings were."
    "I love her. I love Lauren, from the bottom of my heart."
    "But… I don't know if I can actually follow through."

    "I couldn't."    
    "I just wanted her to be happy. Sometimes I wonder if she would have been happier with me, but that's just selfish."
