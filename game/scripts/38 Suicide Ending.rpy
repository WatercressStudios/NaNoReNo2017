    "It's a beautiful day out today! The sun is shining, the trees are blossoming, and school has let us Seniors out for the Summer. It's pretty cool today as well. The breeze feels wonderful on my skin!"

    "I love it. I love days like these. I always have. It's the perfect type of day for a good outing, before I go to work."

    "Loosening up my top, I make my way to her house."

    "It's always strange, seeing it. My chest tightens, and I hesitate just slightly on my path, every time."

    "Sometimes, I like to reminisce in the past. Remember just what she was like. How tired she always seemed, how quiet…"

    "How much she cared for her family, even if it wasn't so obvious."

    "I feel like I could have done more. If we were earlier, if we would have tried just a bit harder, maybe things could have been different."

    "I won't let anyone else see it, but it's what I consider my biggest failure. I will never forgive myself, and I will never forget it all, either."

    "Approaching the door, I knock a few times, and I take a few steps back."

    "A few seconds later, a familiar face exits. She looks at me and waves, hanging her head, as she tends to do nowadays."

    "Let's have some conversation, shall we?"

    "Hmm. I always try to cheer her up, but I haven't been able to lately. It's still fresh in our minds, so I can't exactly blame her for being this way. Still, it hurts to see."

    "I don't let my smile falter."

    "I grab her hand gently, Maria giving little resistance. I get one step off of the porch before I hear the door open behind me."

    "With that, we're off. The world around me is a little bit darker than I'm used to, but it's still sunny outside. The birds still chirp, the squirrels still chitter, and Maria still gets walked to school."

    "If I weren't paying attention, it could almost seem as if nothing's even changed."

    "Alas, the world still turns, even if the one I love is gone."

    "And no matter how much I cry out, she'll never come back to me."
