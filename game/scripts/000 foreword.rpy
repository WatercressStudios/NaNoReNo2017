    n "Firstly, I'd like to thank you for downloading our game."
    
    n "Every individual download means so much to each of us, and nothing makes us happier than knowing that people have taken the time out of their busy lives to play our game in particular."

    n "Secondly, I'd like to include a few warnings."
    
    n "This game, while in a complete state, is not a complete game."
    
    n "Yes, it has all of the assets in place, and the story is finished."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "Despite that, it's most certainly a living game - we're going to be improving this game for a long time coming."
    
    n "We originally made it for the month long gamejam NaNoRenO, and that simply wasn't enough time to make it the best that we possibly could."

    n "We really love this game, and we are dedicated to making this a 'living game'. It will be updated, and it will be improved."

    n "Last of the warnings, this game covers a lot of… sensitive topics."
    
    n "This includes but is not limited to spousal/parental abuse, drug abuse, depression, anxiety, and suicide."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "When we took up this project, we knew that we wanted to send a message about these topics, and raise awareness for them, so we made our best effort to tell a story involving them in the right way."
    
    n "These topics are very near and dear to us, and we only wish to educate the public that these issues are actual issues."
    
    n "We do not wish to make light of them."
    
    n "You may think that your home may never have any of these issues. Your parents may never fight, your siblings may remain clean, and you may live a life without mental illness."
       
    n "This does not, however, mean that these issues aren't important, and it does not imply that they never happen."

    n "They may never happen in your home, but they may happen in your neighbor's, or your aunt’s, or in homes located across the world from you."
    
    n "These issues aren't caused by bad people, they are caused by bad situations. We must not throw them away because we are uneducated."
    
    n "These issues are Human issues. They may not happen in your home, but they happen in our neighborhoods, our countries, in our planet… in Our Home."
    
    n "Thanks for taking the time to play this game, and I hope you enjoy it as much as we did making it."
    
    n "From our ~31 person team to you, thank you so, so much."
    
    nvl clear
    
    n "Finally, thanks to all of the wonderful men and women who helped bring this project to life."
    
    n "It's extremely important to me in particular."
    
    n "I may have never dealt with many of these issues, but I care about them nonetheless - and it brings me to tears knowing that so many talented individuals rallied around my project for this NaNoRenO."
