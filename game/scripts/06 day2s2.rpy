    "The rest of the walk is relatively uneventful, and I make my way to my own school after I've dropped Maria off."

    "I kinda like the walks I take. I have a set endpoint, and there's nothing interfering with me along the way. Sure, the anxiety of class isn't the best thing in the world, but it's like the calm before the storm."

    "I get some peace and quiet. Not much of my life's quiet nowadays, since I'm almost always surrounded by people. Most of the people aren't exactly star citizens, either."

    "While I do hate school with a passion, at least I have a friend there. One single friend, but a friend nonetheless."

    "Speaking of, I wonder if she'll make it to class today? She's been awfully busy with the play."

    "I guess I'll have to wait and see."  

    "I arrive at the school, moving quickly towards the senior lockers - Lauren'll be nearby, surely. We  have a habit of meeting up before class, and it always brightens my day."

    "Okay. I need to wake up. I've practically been dragging myself through the motions this morning, and I'd rather not 'go through the motions' with Lauren. That'd be a disservice."

    "I move past the huddled masses, weaving through the waves of students that occupy this part of the school every morning."

    "I skip right by my locker, carrying everything I need with me."

    "In the distance, I see it."

    "The bright red hair, the slightly risque uniform, the bright blue eyes. She spots me and waives enthusiastically."

    "...But I have to go anyways. I don't want to deal with the blowback of yet another absence. Mother would kill me."

    "Well, that'd probably be preferable to the alternative."

    "Oh well. I suck it up and make my way into the classroom, making sure to avoid any and all human interaction on the way. I'm not exactly the most popular person here."

    "Sitting down, I pull out my class supplies, including the books that weigh down my bag."

    "Shortly thereafter, the teacher walks in, and the lesson begins."
