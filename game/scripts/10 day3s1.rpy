    sis "I, uhh, okay…"

    "She hugs back with a fervor that I wasn't quite expecting."
   
    "That's probably a result of a lack of attention; I think she really craves affection, something she doesn't really get from the rest of the family."
  
    "So… during the few times I humor her, she's on me tighter than a corset."
    
    "It's… confusing. But I don't hate it. It's fun for the both of us."
  
    "She pulls away, and looks at me inquisitively."

    "I walk to the kitchen, grabbing a decent sized mug to fit some coffee in."

    "As expected, my brother isn't ready for school just yet. I peeked in his room when I passed it, and he's still sitting in his bed, looking at his phone."

    "His backpack was still a mess, books strewn around his room without a single care. His textbooks were worn and faded, and his lined composite notebooks were all crushed and torn."

    "That boy, he needs to get his shit together. Thankfully, my mother isn't out here to notice."

    "I pop in some toast, buttering it for my sister to eat on her way to school."

    "My only request is for a slow, quiet, drama free day. I don't think I can take much more and remain sane."

    "If it weren't for the few bright lights in my life, God knows where I'd be."

    "At least I have a good amount of time with Lauren to look forward to. The research going into costume design is relatively boring, but with her? I'm sure it'll go over quite well."

    "It's a good thing, having someone by my side. It forces me to get real work done."

    "...It also makes it that much less lonely."

    "I eat my own serving of toast before wrapping the rest in a paper towel. I don't want any crumbs to fall onto the floor."

    "My mother cleans the kitchen meticulously, and she'd prefer it to stay that way. Can't say I blame her. I can only blame her reactions to when things don't quite go her way."

    "Looking at the time impatiently, I yell out to my sister."

    "I'm the rock others can cling to in their time of need. That's what Lauren would say, at least."
