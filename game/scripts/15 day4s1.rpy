    "Sunlight pierces my eyes."
    "My body chills and shivers as blood rushes through my veins, thrusting me into the world of the living once more."
    "…Do I really have to wake up now?"
    "The effort to keep my eyelids open almost feels like too much, if not for the sunlight that bleeds into my vision and scrapes at my pupils." 
    "I get up from my bed and loosely stand on my own two feet. My muscles strain and ache as I stretch away whatever ill-fated weights once locked my shoulders in place." 
    "I grab my uniform, get dressed and get ready for school – it’s like an average, regular day, except my fingers are numb with pain and my back is in desperate need of a spa day."
