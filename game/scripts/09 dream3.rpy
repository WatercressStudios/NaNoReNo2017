    "The transition is seamless, as expected. The air is a very soothing room temperature; not quite cold, and yet not hot either. It's peaceful."
    
    "A gentle wind brushes against my hair, down my back, kissing my skin, embracing me. Across from me, I find my brother sipping a cup of warm tea."

    "Mom's cooking is actually very lovely. An excellent treat for our family, all gathered around the table."

    "The smoked ham is perfectly cooked, my knife cutting through it like the butter on my biscuits. Speaking of, those are a perfect golden brown, cut hamburger style with a sizable bit of melted butter nuzzled in there."

    "I look around the table, smiling at the family surrounding me. It feels so warm, and everything is emanating a pleasing golden glow. I couldn't ask for a better family to spend my dinner and my life with."

    "My father at one end, my mother at the other, and my brother sitting across from me. A happy family of four."

    "Despite this, I get an eery feeling that something is missing."

    "I'm not quite sure what it is, though. What could be missing from this perfect family? Surely nothing, right?"

    "Looking next to me, I see a plate set aside with a small meal in front of an empty chair. How odd…"
