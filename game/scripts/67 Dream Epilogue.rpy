    Dpro "It's been awhile hasn't it?"

    "The world around me is bright, but not blindingly so. It's new, and it's refreshing."

    "I know that I'm dreaming. I've been here before, but it's different this time."

    pro "It's been years…"

    Dpro "That, it has."

    "In front of me stands, well, me."

    "It's odd. Have I always looked like this? I look better than I used to, back when these types of dreams were a staple of my life."

    play voice "20-6-2.mp3" #potato
    pro "Why am I here?"

    Dpro "Because you've been wanting some finality. The dreams you used to have disappeared with little warning."

    Dpro "You wanted your story to wrap up, nice and tidy."

    "It's true, the dreams did fade away. Sometimes, I still miss them. Now, however? I don't need them. Sure, many aspects of my life didn't go exactly the way I had planned, but…"

    "At least I'm here, right?"

    Dpro "I wanted to thank you."

    play voice "20-6-3.mp3" #potato
    pro "Thank me?"

    Dpro "Yes. You made a decision, and that single decision brought you to this point. If you would have chosen wrong, you very well could have been in a much, much more tragic place."

    Dpro "You are here because you decided to make something of yourself. You chose the real world. You chose to go home."

    play voice "20-6-4.mp3" #potato
    pro "I guess that's true. It's interesting, how a single decision could hold so much weight, especially given how many decisions one makes on a daily basis."

    Dpro "Many of them don't matter, but sometimes…"

    play voice "20-6-5.mp3" #potato
    pro "You'll find yourself on a crossroads."

    Dpro "You'll find yourself asking the {i}right questions{/i}."

    play voice "20-6-6.mp3" #potato
    pro "And I made the right choice?"

    Dpro "That, you did."

    Dpro "No matter how well or poorly your life is going so far, it's much better than the alternative."

    Dpro "You chose to live, and you chose to start living - two things that are not necessarily the same thing."

    play voice "20-6-7.mp3" #potato
    pro "But they aren't always mutually exclusive, either."

    Dpro "Right."

    play voice "20-6-8.mp3" #potato
    pro "Yeah, you're right. I'm in a better place than I used to be."

    Dpro "And you did that all on your own."

    "She comes close, putting a hand on my shoulder."

    Dpro "You chose our home."

    Dpro "And Emily?"

    play voice "20-6-9.mp3" #potato
    pro "Yeah?"

    #Next line should occupy the middle of the screen if possible. Larger text, it should stand out. It's the last four words that the player will see each time they get an Act 2 ending.

    Dpro "I'm proud of you."
