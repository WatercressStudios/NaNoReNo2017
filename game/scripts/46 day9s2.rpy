    "It’s not like we haven’t been spending time together before, but usually our parents would be across the hall."
    "This time it really will be just the two of us."
    "I kind of like the idea. I’m glad Lauren talked me into it."
    "I sigh."
    "There's been so much to do since Mom disappeared."
    "And the production for the drama show's just been ramping up, so…"
    "I know it's been difficult for Lauren as well." 
    "She's able to put on a brave face, so… I should do the same."
    "...Heh. I should be more of an adult about this whole thing, but…"
    "Having the house to me and Lauren… the idea's giving me butterflies."
    "Lunch is almost over. I need to think about my classes more, not this mushy stuff."
    "Then, I have to go see Alex and check up on him."
    "After I think that, Lauren comes around."
    "At least I have one thing to look forward to."
