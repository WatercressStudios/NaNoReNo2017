    "Laying on my bed, I realize that I'm… I'm actually crying."

    "I'm not sure when I started crying, but I'm doing it nonetheless."

    "The road to hell is paved with good intentions, right? Fuck, I can't even rationalize what just happened… let alone justify my behavior during it all."

    if scoldalex:
        "I fueled the fire."

    else:
        "I let the fire burn."

    "I only made it worse. How could I've been so blind? My brother's in obvious pain…"

    "More importantly, how could our own mother be so blind? She must know that she's tearing him apart… right?"

    "He'd never lay a hand on Maria, ever. Not under normal circumstances. So, the fact that he did changes everything."

    "Mom fucked everything up."

    "She did this."

    "It's her fault."

    "Maria told me not to blame myself, but she didn't say a damn thing about Mom."

    "I so desperately want her to just… go away. Disappear. She's only ever hurt us. She's done nothing for us so far."

    "She's not even worthless. She's worth {i}less{/i} than worthless."

    "And, of course, Dad wasn't here. Again. Forever the absentee father."

    "Should I be doing something? I felt so powerless… and I still do. There's nothing I can do to change Mom's mind."

    "And Dad won't ever be home."

    "I'm so sick and fucking tired of being helpless! I'm tired of only being capable of hiding away! I wish I could do more, but every time I try to do so, shit only gets worse."

    "There's a reason why I avoid conflict."

    "Everything I touch turns to ash."

    "The one good thing, the ONE good thing that I've done in the past week was instigated by Lauren."

    "It wasn't even me. I only followed along with her idea."

    "I feel like a waste of space right now."

    "...and I bet Alex feels even worse."

    "I just don't know what to do."

    "I try to wipe the tears from my eyes, but they just keep coming. I don't know whether I'm crying from fear, or frustration, or sadness, or all of the above."

    "I'm just crying like a toddler. I'm just feeling sorry for myself. I'm ignoring our home again. I'm just thinking about myself."

    "I'm selfish. I'm so fucking selfish."

    "Why can't I be more like Lauren?"

    "She'd know just what to do at a time like this. She'd know the right answer. She'd, she'd, she'd…"

    "But this isn't her. I'm not her."

    "And I can't keep pretending that I need her."

    "No matter how much it may be true."

    "I am old enough to be self reliant, even in a situation like this…"

    "But I'm just too tired to even begin finding a solution."

    "My body aches, my head's numb, and I just want to give up on the world. I just want to fall asleep… and never wake up."

    "However, I have to wake up eventually, don't I?"
