    voice "3-2-112.mp3" #potato

    voice "3-2-113.mp3" #starleeter
    lov "Yeah, they're fruity and creamy and perfectly sweet, like me!" 

    "I sigh, avoiding her gaze. I shove my face into my book, closing it around me, my messy hair getting tangled up and matted down."

    voice "3-3-9.mp3" #potato

    voice "3-3-11.mp3" #potato
    pro "No, it's fine, you don't have to pay for me."

    "I hate it when people pay for me. It's a nice gesture, but it only serves to reinforce my worries. It takes out even the smallest of choice that I have in my life."

    "I guess I should listen to my own advice, however. She's being nice, so I should just 'suck it up'."

    "She stares at me with knowing eyes. She's aware that I'm conflicted."

    voice "3-3-12.mp3" #potato

    voice "3-3-14.mp3" #potato
    pro "Thank you, even if that was expected."

    "Sticking my tongue out at her, I pack my shit and motion towards the door."

    "Her tongue reaches out just as quickly. I'm sure we look like idiots right now, but it doesn't really bother me. I like Lauren, and she's one of the parts of life that I honestly say I can look forward to."

    voice "3-3-15.mp3" #starleeter
    lov "So, what coffee ya gunna get? The boring old drip coffee? So blaannnd!"

    "I'm shoved to the side as she jabs her fingers into my waist. Hey! I'm not thick enough for that…"

    voice "3-3-16.mp3" #potato
    pro "Hey, cut it out! That hurts!"

    "She giggles, poking harder and harder, joining in with both hands."

    lov "C'mon, wake up a bit. I know you're not getting enough sleep, but maybe if I tired you out a bit before, you'll hit your bed like a sack of rocks!"

    "Nooo! She pulls me forward, her walk turning to a skip and a half."

    voice "3-3-20.mp3" #potato
    pro "God, why do you have to be so embarrassing?"

    "I jog next to her, refusing to give in to her childish tendencies."

    "Thankfully, my own personal hell ends just as quickly as it had started - we arrive at the coffeeshop."

    "Lauren's eyes light up like a christmas tree, like they always tend to do whenever there's a seasonal special drink available. She always likes the fruity ones."

    "Thankfully, they don't tend to have a lot of coffee in them. If they did… dear god, I wouldn't know what to do with her."

    "Oddly enough, as I gaze at the signs inside the shop, I realize that there isn't a seasonal coffee in stock."

    "There's something much, much more interesting in store for us."

    voice "3-3-21.mp3" #starleeter
    lov "Hey, Emily? Isn't that your father?"

    voice "3-3-22.mp3" #potato
    pro "...Yeah, that is."

    "I'm surprised she recognized him. She has a pretty damn good photographic memory, however, so I guess it makes sense. I'm sure she's seen photos of my family, through social media or otherwise."

    voice "3-3-23.mp3" #starleeter
    lov "Well? We should go visit him! I'm sure he'd love the company!"

    voice "3-3-24.mp3" #potato
    pro "Ehh, I dunno. I haven't talked to him in a while."

    "I'm not exactly comfortable in conversation with him. We just don't know each other like we used to. Nowhere near close."

    "Lauren had different ideas, however."

    voice "3-3-25.mp3" #potato
    pro "Hey! Wait up, don't just walk up to him!"

    "Lauren enters the shop, leaving me in the dust. Through the window I see her walk right up to him, sparking up a conversation as if it were the simplest thing in the world."

    "She looks over and points at me. She waves with an ecstatic smile."

    "Begrudgingly, I enter the store and walk up to him."

    voice "3-3-27.mp3" #lacTheWatcher
    dad "Hi sweetie. It's nice to see you here, such a pleasant surprise."

    "Next to me, Lauren's practically beaming. She is somewhat aware of my home situation, so she's probably loving this little father-daughter bonding moment."

    "It's only uncomfortable for me."

    "Here he is, right in front of me. Someone I've all but stopped missing. Someone I haven't really bonded with as of late."

    "Why am I so nervous? He's my own father. Given that, why does he feel like a stranger to me?"

    "I don't understand."

    "But I do understand that he's right in front of me, sipping on a cup of coffee, hunched over the counter with bags in his eyes matching my own."

    "He looks tired. Defeated. He looks like he has no life left, the light in his eyes gone."

    "I wonder if that's how I look?"

    "If so, I don't know why Lauren would enjoy my company so much, after all these years."

    "Hell, my dad even has the same unkempt hair that I do, and that's not genetic. For a fleeting moment, I feel… concerned."

    voice "3-3-28.mp3" #potato
    pro "Yeah, Lauren here wanted to catch a drink real quick. We've been researching stuff for her play."

    voice "3-3-30.mp3" #lacTheWatcher
    dad "Oh? That's wonderful Emily. You've grown up so much, and you're being so proactive. I'm happy to see you two together. At least you aren't alone while I'm gone."

    "Well. Perhaps being alone would be better than the loneliness that comes with our household. If you were around more, you'd understand."

    voice "3-3-31.mp3" #potato
    pro "Ehh, it's nothing. Lauren, roped me in, there wasn't really a choice in the matter anyways."

    voice "3-3-34.mp3" #potato
    pro "They've been better. School's still, well, school. Mom's still Mom. Maria's getting older, which is pretty cool. She's still a shy one, though."

    voice "3-3-35.mp3" #lacTheWatcher
    dad "Ahh, that's, uhh, good to hear. Listen, honey, I'm sorry for not being around more. If I were, I know that things would be better, but… We have to make due with what we have."

    voice "3-3-36.mp3" #potato
    pro "Yeah…"

    voice "3-3-37.mp3" #lacTheWatcher
    dad "I have to put food on the table somehow, even if it means… even if it means that I have to watch you grow up from a distance."

    "He takes a sip from his coffee, letting it draw out. He's probably thinking of what to say next."

    voice "3-3-38.mp3" #lacTheWatcher
    dad "Unfortunately, we're not in a situation to have the perfect family. It kills me inside to say that this coffee is the one thing in my day to day life that I look forward to. It hurts to say that I don't get to see the family that I love so, so much."

    voice "3-3-39.mp3" #lacTheWatcher
    dad "You, your brother, your sister - you three are the reason I live right now, no matter how little I get to see you, and I'm sorry that I can't be home everyday."

    "I decide to stop him right there."

    voice "3-3-40.mp3" #potato
    pro "Yeah, I understand. There's not much you can do."

    "He's already said more than he should - he's slipping up. He's a lot more tired than I'm sure he wants us to know."

    "Thankfully, he's talking to me and not the others. I'm mature enough to understand without letting it get to me to much."

    voice "3-3-41.mp3" #potato

    pro "Me, you, and your children. That's all we want."

    "I let him off easy. There are plenty of choice words a more emotional person would say at this point, but it's no use. I'd rather not shake the nest, especially with him. He's more like I am than I'd like to admit."

    voice "3-3-43.mp3" #lacTheWatcher
    dad "Yeah, I'll see what I can do. My boss isn't too rough on me, thankfully, so I'll try my best. Sorry for… everything, Emily. I mean it."

    voice "3-3-44.mp3" #potato
    pro "Water under the bridge."

    "I leave it like that. I don't like having an absentee father, but making a big deal out of it won't help. It's best to leave things where they lay."

    "dad slumps over against the counter, defeated. He tears at his hair for a bit, moving back up with a sigh."

    voice "3-3-45.mp3" #lacTheWatcher
    dad "Alright, I have to go back to work. Break's ending soon, and I have a long shift ahead of me, like always. Thanks for stopping by. It's really nice to get to see you, it makes my work seem a little less soul crushingly rough."

    "He looks over to Lauren with a smile."

    voice "3-3-46.mp3" #lacTheWatcher

    voice "3-3-47.mp3" #starleeter

    dad "Goodbye all."

    "She's earned herself a small smile out of me, but my mind's still in a dark spot. I don't know if her support will be enough. I don't know if I deserve her support."

    "I don't know if things will ever get better, with or without me. Sometimes, I wonder if things would be better without me, but I always try to force my mind onto other matters."

    "Well, even if I were to leave, I doubt my mother would learn her lesson. She'd never change, she's convinced me that much."

    voice "3-3-59.mp3" #potato
    pro "That's good to hear, thank you."

    "We end the outing with little more than idle chatter. Today's been an exhausting day. More running around than I'm used to."
