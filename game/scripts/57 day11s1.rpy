    "Alex's back from the hospital. He's looking better than… well, better than he looked a few days ago."
    "Small victories. He's still recovering, can't forget that."
    "Maybe I'm just not a morning person. Or maybe… they're just so much more hectic with Mom gone."

    "Well. Life goes on, I guess. Better get ready for school."
