    "...Wait, this is geometry. Ugh, don't care."
    "I should probably get over what happened at home today, but… I've been too busy mulling over things I want to say later."
    "Right now I've been rehearsing things I {i}should've{/i} said to Dad, but didn't."
    "'Like, 'if you were a real man, you'd be looking for her right now!'"

    "Damn it… well, I guess it's not as bad as coming up with the perfect line to say, well after the argument."

    "...My hand reaches reflexively towards my pocket to pull out my phone, but the message is clear in my head."
    "Mom's home. She came back."
    "...Why do I feel relief from all this?"
    "I should hate the bitch for walking out on us! Maria's been worried sick…"
    "And, and Alex! He was nearly dead, and what'd she do? Nothing, right!?"
    "Ugh… and I'm gonna have to see her again tonight. Her old same smug demeanor, as if nothing happened at all."
    "...What am I even going to say? We'd be better off without her, but… the way Dad was talking about her."
    "I know. He'd want me to forgive her… pretend we're a family again."

    "...Oh God, I was supposed to take care of Alex… and I screwed up… I screwed up {i}really bad{/i}..."
    "Mom already thinks I'm worthless… and I guess I am, in a way. I don't really help around the house, and leave it all to her…" 
    "She gave me one job, and that was to watch Alex. She trusted me with even that one thing, and I let her down."
    "And now she's come back, and she's...  I don't know what she's going to do."
    # TODO: flashback to scene of mother with dazed look in her eyes from when she left

    "That look in her eyes, the morning she left. What was she thinking??"
    "She… I think something snapped and… she's always managed to keep herself just together enough."
    "She never hit us or anything, but… I don't want Maria to witness that."
    "Maria just needs to… hide in her room. Wait for all to blow over."
    "Maria, she idolizes Mom for what she is, faults and all. I want her to hold onto that feeling."
    "...I wish I could stick my head in the sand, and pretend it all goes away, but... I'm an adult now. I have to talk to Mom."
    "I have to know, but… God, it feels like it's been too soon, even after everything…"

    "I close my eyes and rest my head against my desk, tuning out the lecture."
    "What am I going to say tonight… why did she come back at all, after everything that happened?"
    "Please, just let it pass. Just let this awful day pass already…"
