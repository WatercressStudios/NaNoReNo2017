    "Stepping out of the cab, I find myself back at our home. It looks different than I remember, oddly enough. It's dark, vacant, lifeless."

    "I hate my mother, and yet, the house is fragmented without her. It's missing its heart."

    "No one else really deserves that title, being the heart of the house. She's a despicable woman, but she's still our mother."

    "She's still my mom."

    "I want to trust her. I want to love her. I want everything to be a-okay. That simply won't happen if we continue to hold this animosity towards her, right?"

    "She abandoned us, though. I can't just forgive her that easily." 

    "I make my way inside, finding it to be much more solitary than I had originally thought."

    "No one's home… except for a lone figure huddled up on the couch."

    "She's normally never left alone, but I guess desperate times, right?"

    "I approach her carefully, trying to avoid waking her. I gently pull her close to me, lifting her from the couch, carrying her to her room."

    "Fuck, I woke her up."

    pro "Ahh, that's okay. He's working really hard to keep this family together. I'm here for you, anyways."

    "I whisper to her, lowering her to her bed. Kissing her on the forehead, I wrap her in a blanket."

    play voice "8-4-8.mp3" #potato
    pro "He…"

    "I want to tell her that it will end up okay."

    "I really do…"

    "But I saw him. I {i}saw{/i} him."

    "He looked awful. He looked like he was dying. I've been operating on autopilot this entire day, and it's hitting me now."

    "It's hard to get the vision of him out of my head."

    "Everytime I close my eyes, I see the way he was, his face…"

    "I shake it out of my mind."

    pro "I don't know… but don't worry about him, okay? Get some sleep."

    "She gives me one last pained look before turning away, covering herself with the warm blankets and pillows surrounding her."

    "Patting her on the head, I give her my farewells and head off to my room."

    "My bed is as comfortable as ever, and my dreams call to me…"

    "Now's not the time."

    "I need to think about what I'm going to do moving forward. Worst case scenario, Mom doesn't come back, Dad continues to work his shitty shift, and my brother… well."

    "Let's not think of the worst case scenario. Let's think of what we can do to make the best out of our current situation."

    "Tomorrow, I'll have to make sure to visit Alex. He needs all of the support he can get. Start small, Emily. Work on things you can impact first. Namely, your siblings."

    "That's what I have to do. I need to stay involved with Maria and Alex. I have to be the rock for them. I'm the older sibling, so it's my job, as Mom used to tell me."

    "Rolling over in my bed, I bring my pillows close, forcing myself to catch some rest. I can't do everything without sleep… Lauren would kill me."

    "I wonder what I'll dream about today?"
