    pro "Thank you for shopping at Walmart, ma'am. Next person, please."

    "I didn't think I'd end up here. Life has a way of catching up with you." 
    "There's so many brand-name t-shirts, pajamas, caps and hats..."
    "Cheaply-made. Pressed in a factory, probably. For a fraction of the price."
    "And they pass the savings onto the rest of us..."
    "Maybe it was a good idea, letting go of that old fantasy. Would've been hard to compete with the mechanical efficiency of mass production."

    pro "Fuck no, I'm not giving my number to a creepy old man. Thank you for shopping at Walmart, now fuck off so I can serve the next customer."

    "And just like that, I'm fired. Again."
    "Ah well, I'm used to unemployment by now. I heard my old school is hiring a janitor. Maybe I should apply."
    "Time to say goodbye to this lousy job..."

    voice "20-11-12.mp3" #potato
    pro "No."

    "It's awkward between us. I haven't seen her in years, since her performance at the highschool theatre production."
    "It was a hit. I was happy for Lauren, and I would've stayed for the after party, but I had other things on my mind that night. I had to get home and make sure there was food on the table for my family."
    "After that, it was the same story every time we tried to hang out. We'd make plans, but I had to cancel because of some family emergency or some important chore that needed to be done."
    "Months passed, and we started calling each other less and less. We both graduated from high school, so we had even less reason to see each other in person."
    "Eventually, we stopped calling each other at all. This was four years ago."
    "It's strange bumping into Lauren here, like this."
    "Maybe... this is a good thing. Maybe this is the universe's way of extending the proverbial olive branch, by giving me a chance to reconnect with Lauren."

    "W-Wife?"
    "I don't know why, but something compels me to look down at Lauren's shopping bag."
    "Inside the Walmart plastic bag are baby formula, baby diapers, and—"

    lov "Oh, this? We just adopted the most adorable little boy from Laos. Do you... do you wanna see his picture?"

    "Lauren unlocks her smartphone and pulls up a picture on the screen."
    "It's a picture of Lauren, her adopted son... and her beautiful wife."
    "I feel a stab in my heart."

    voice "20-11-18.mp3" #potato
    pro "No."

    "Lauren was gonna say 'my wife'. She actually wants me to meet her wife and rub the beautiful family they've made together in my face."

    "I don't even have the strength to wish her well. I just turn and walk in the opposite direction she's going."
    "I don't give myself time to cry. There's no time for that. I have to get dinner ready at home."
    "Why did my boss wait until the end of my shift before firing me? He could've given me some extra time at home and saved me the misery of bumping into Lauren."
    "Something about not focusing on my work enough. What a load of shit."
    "Ugh, I'm so mad! It's just as well I'm fired... another day there I'd end up strangling my boss."

    scene diningroom with dissolve 

    "The first thing I see when I walk through the front door are Alex's shoes, messily kicked into the hallway. I feel my eyebrow tick upwards in annoyance. At least Maria's shoes are neatly arranged on the shoe rack."

    voice "20-11-24.mp3" #potato
    pro "Alex! The next time I see your shoes making a mess of the hallway I'm throwing them out!"

    "I don't get a reply, but I imagine he's rolling his eyes in his room right now."

    scene bedroom with dissolve 

    "I drop my bag in my room and pick up the laundry basket. On my way out, I feel the basket knocking something off the table."
    "THUD! CRACK!"
    "Looking down, I see my grandmother's sewing machine, the one I haven't used in almost five years. It seems that the drop has broken the old thing in half."
    "I feel a dull pain rising in my chest, but I push it down. I have no time to mourn a machine that I no longer use. So I kick it aside and leave my room with the laundry basket."

    scene bathroom with dissolve 
    "Five sets of used bedsheets, pillow cases, blankets and towels... not to mention all of our smelly clothes and undergarments."
    "There's also the table cloth stained by Alex's clumsiness and a few damp toilet rugs because someone in my family can't keep the shower curtains closed."
    "They won't all fit in one load of washing. I’ll do one today, and wash the rest early tomorrow."

    scene diningroom with dissolve 
    "I also have to vacuum the rooms, dust the shelves, dry the laundry, fold the laundry, scrub the toilet, scrub the bathtub, mow the lawn, sweep off the dried leaves, check the mailbox, pay the bills, balance the budget, buy more groceries..."
    "...but I'll have to put all that off until after cooking dinner. It's already 7:30pm."

    voice "20-11-25.mp3" #potato
    pro "Alex, Maria, clean up after yourselves!"

    "Frustrated, I take the milk-stained glasses and bowls on the dining table and dump them into the sink before I start cooking."
    "Honestly, how hard is it to leave used dishes in the sink?"
    "I didn't have time to do any cooking preparations, so I pull a bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer and empty its contents in a pot of boiling water."
    "While the stew is boiling, I run the tap and start washing the dirty dishes."
    "However, the drying rack is full, so I have to take a few minutes to dry everything in the damn rack first."
    "By the time I'm done, the stew is almost ready, so I start setting the table."

    pro "Dinner is ready! Everyone, get over here, now!"

    "Maria walks up a minute later, but Alex doesn't."
    "I clench my jaw. It's the same thing every time. I march angrily to my brother's room and pound on his door."

    voice "20-11-27.mp3" #potato
    pro "Alex! Get the fuck to the dining room. I don't have all day!"

    "I hear an irritated groan behind the door and some footsteps stumbling around, before the door swings open."

    bro "Okay, geez, there's no need to yell... I was napping."

    "Considering Alex's hair and disheveled appearance, he's not lying. But why does he need to nap so much?"
    "Once all of us but Dad are in the dining room, I scoop their food into their bowls."

    "The table becomes silent after that. No one else says a word for the rest of the dinner. After cleaning up the bowls, I stop by a wall mirror in the hallway."
    "Slowly, I turn to it and look at myself, and what I've become..."
