    ##scene should have some sort of foreboding or harrowing OST. Think deadangle from Umineko.

    "…It got rather cold today."
    "At some point, the sun dipped below the horizon once more. Another freezing night in the middle of the fall has begun."
    "I’m wrapped in my blankets to stave off the cold, huddling my arms together as I shiver from the sensation in the air."
    "Time continues to pass."
    "It’s 8 PM, ten hours since this morning’s fight. My head still thumps with pain and the very act of being awake makes me feel like I’m about to topple over. I want to go to sleep. Why do I have to be here again?"

    "KNOCK~ KNOCK~"

    sis "Emi? Are you awake?"

    "My sister’s voice is coming through the wall. It makes sense, her bedroom’s behind this wall. It’s the first time she’s doing this, though. There’s an exhaustion in her voice that tells me Maria’s tired and struggling to stay awake."

    "BEEP~ The number you are calling is currently unavailable. BEEP~"

    voice "7-3-13.mp3" #potato

    "I speak into the empty receiver for Maria. She looks so worried, and I’m afraid if I say anything else, she’ll run out looking for Alex herself."

    voice "7-3-15.mp3" #amree
    sis "H-hey, let me talk to him!"

    "Maria reaches for the phone and tries to pull it from my hand. I hit the end button with my thumb as it falls to the ground. She picks it up and looks at the screen."

    "She nods. Her face is facing the ground, and she slowly walks back to her room."
    "However, because of what Maria said, I can’t help but be worried about Alex, too. So I try giving his phone another ring."
    "Hmm… the same automated voice message."
    "..."
    "I’m sure it’s nothing. In any case, Maria needs me here, so I have to stay here."
    "Fifteen minutes later, I hear Mom calling for Maria about her bandages. I want to know how Maria’s head is doing, too, so I walk out to the dining room."
    "Mom gently inspects the bandages before nodding and saying it’s fine. It occurs to me Mom hasn’t mentioned Alex since the fight this morning."
    "Around the corner, the locks on the front door clang open. Maria immediately turns around."

    "As he starts up the car engine, he tells me to call up Lauren just in case Alex is there. Then he drives away."
    "I don’t call Lauren, however, since Alex doesn’t know where she lives or even have her number."
    "As I walk down the street, I notice that my heart’s pounding and my hands are trembling. Why?"
    "It’s just another fight. There isn’t anything to worry about."
    "Whatever happened will resolve itself, and we’ll go back to the same fucked-up lives we’ve always had and ignore it until another fight happens."
    "That’s how our family works, right? That’s how it’s always worked."
    "There’s nothing to worry about. He’s going to be at that park or something like he was last time. He leaves, he comes home, then everything goes back to normal. If it weren’t for Dad and Maria, I’d still be at home. That’s how this works, right?"
    "I come up on the park after a ten, fifteen minute walk. My phone says it’s 8:30 PM."
    "Alex isn’t here. He probably never even came here to begin with. If he wanted to go somewhere, he’d have stayed there. He isn’t the kind who moves much if he’s comfortable where he wants to be."
    "I sigh. Maybe I’ll call Lauren after all. I pull out my phone and dial her number."
