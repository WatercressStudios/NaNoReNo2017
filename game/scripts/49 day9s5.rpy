    "It’s late by the time we realise that no one has come home."
    "Honestly, Lauren and I probably wouldn’t have noticed if Maria hadn’t knocked on the door to say she was hungry."
    "I checked my phone and sure enough, it was way past our usual dinner time."
    "Where the heck is Mom?"
    voice "9-5-1.mp3" #potato

    "At first I’m confused. And then it hits me like a ton of bricks."
    voice "9-5-4.mp3" #potato
    pro "Maria, how did you get home today?"
    "She shrugs shyly."
    voice "9-5-5.mp3" #amree

    voice "9-5-7.mp3" #amree
    sis "I-I’m sorry, I-I know I’m not supposed to… I waited for two hours but no one came..."
    voice "9-5-8.mp3" #potato
    pro "T-Two hours?!"
    "What the hell is going on?!"
    "I’m about to say something else when we hear Maria’s stomach grumbling. She looks down guiltily and covers her stomach with her hands, as if that’ll stop the grumbling."

    voice "9-5-13.mp3" #starleeter
    lov "Let’s get down to the kitchen and work, then."
    "We all troop into the kitchen."
    "Honestly, it feels a little weird making dinner. This was always Mom’s domain and she was really fussy about what you did in here."
    "I’d been screamed at for using the wrong stuff to make a sandwich."
    voice "9-5-14.mp3" #starleeter

    voice "9-5-16.mp3" #starleeter
    lov "Alright, you put some water onto boil and I’ll see if you have anything for a sauce."
    "The three of us worked together for the next little while. Lauren was a lot better at cooking than she let on and soon enough, we were eating dinner at the table."
    voice "9-5-17.mp3" #amree
    sis "This is great!"
    voice "9-5-18.mp3" #starleeter

    voice "9-5-29.mp3" #potato
    pro "Wh-what?"
    "He sighs."
    voice "9-5-30.mp3" #lacTheWatcher

    voice "9-5-31.mp3" #lacTheWatcher
    dad "I guess... I guess she just needs some time to alone to work things out."
    "He shakes his head."
    voice "9-5-32.mp3" #lacTheWatcher

    voice "9-5-34.mp3" #lacTheWatcher
    dad "We just needed the money. We all needed it, or else we’d have no roof over our heads."
    "Dragging fingers through his hair, he sat back away from his dinner."
